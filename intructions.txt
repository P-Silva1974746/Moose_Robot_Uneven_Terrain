Instructions:
This projecto is both compatible with Windows 10 and Linux. For this work to be replicated it is necessary to have installed the simulator webots.
It is necessary to set up your installation in order to have access to the Webots code library, in th IDE we used Pycharm this consists of setting the following environment variables:
PYTHONPATH: /usr/local/webots/lib/controller/python:
WEBOTS_HOME: /usr/local/webots

1-It is necessary to install the python packages listed in requirements.txt
2- To run the A* and Greedy algorithm using Pycharm it is necessary to have webots opened and one of the perlin_noise maps opened, then just run it via the run button of Pycharm
3- To run the A2C it is necessary to have to terminals opened as well as the Webots with the map loaded, first we run controllers/moose_gym/moose_controller.py in one terminal
only after that controller is running we can run in the other terminal the train.py

To create or evaluate maps is just running the env_maker or the height_anal in the terminal, change the path to the one you want
